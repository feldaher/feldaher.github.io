## Diffusion Racer

I created an interactive simulation that demonstrates how molecules move through cells via diffusion. Adjust temperature and cytoplasm viscosity to see how they affect molecular movement in real-time.
This is (hopefully) educational game, so don't get too upset if it's not fully realistic!

### How to Play

1. Use the temperature slider to adjust thermal energy in the system
2. Modify cytoplasm viscosity to see how it impacts molecular movement
3. Press Start to begin the simulation
4. Watch how different sized molecules (oxygen, glucose, and proteins) move differently


### The Science

This game demonstrates several important biological principles:
- Brownian motion increases with temperature
- Molecular size affects diffusion rates
- Cytoplasm viscosity impacts molecular movement
- Concentration gradients drive molecular movement
